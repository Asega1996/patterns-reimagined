# Patterns Reimagined

**Patterns Reimagined** is a repository that reinterprets classic design patterns, comparing their traditional object-oriented implementations with modern alternatives based on functional programming, TypeScript, and contemporary frontend development practices.

The goal is to understand how these patterns evolve in a modern ecosystem—often becoming simpler, more expressive, or even unnecessary thanks to modules, pure functions, reactive programming, and modern architecture patterns.
