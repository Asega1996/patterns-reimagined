# Singleton

The **Singleton** pattern ensures that a class or module exposes a single shared instance across the entire application.  
Traditionally used in object-oriented systems to control global state, configuration, or shared resources.

In modern functional and frontend architectures, singletons often emerge naturally from importing modules, closures, or top-level variables, making the explicit pattern less necessary.

In both examples, the Singleton is implemented as a simple **logger** responsible for printing messages to the console.
